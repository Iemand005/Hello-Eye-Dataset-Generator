# IRCameraView

This is a demo that shows how to access the Windows Hello infrared camera feed.

## Download Demo

You can try the [prerelease version](https://github.com/Iemand005/IRCameraView/releases/tag/0.1.1), which includes extra features like frame filtering, or download the [latest stable release](https://github.com/Iemand005/IRCameraView/releases/latest).

For reference, the only other example I found on how to do this is: https://github.com/andresbeltranc/ir_camera_sample_win32
